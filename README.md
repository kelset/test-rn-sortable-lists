# Sortable lists in React Native

This is but a sample project that wants to reach a performant list with the ability to sort via drag-n-drop.

The code in here is really ugly, as I am trying to minimize the API needed for the "sortable list component".

If you want to take a look at it, please feel free but, again, I'm not really proud of the code here atm.

## Demo

## TODO

- [ ] make the code less ugly, atm is unwatchable
- [ ] migrate to actually use [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated) for the list

### Acknowledgements

The examples in this lib are based on:

- Reanimated Example folder
- @gyetvan-andras's [react-native-dnd-list](https://github.com/gyetvan-andras/react-native-dnd-list) sample implementation
- @vTrip's [FlatListSortable](https://github.com/vTrip/FlatListSortable) fork of @deanmcpherson's [react-native-sortable-listview](https://github.com/deanmcpherson/react-native-sortable-listview)

Thanks for sharing your code, you are all awesome!
